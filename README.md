## The Project

For our project we wanted to design a website that would attract users to the site and be incredibly accessible. This would be accomplished by using semantic HTML and choosing a design that is incredibly readable. To accomplish this were going to add aria values that will help the screen reader describe whats going on. As a group we wanted a way to express ourselves artistically while showing off the CSS and JS tricks we learned.

### The Group

- Arturo
- Abshir
- Mo
- Anthony

### PM Tools

Our group will be utilizing a few tools in order to ensure the development process goes over smoothly. The first is Trello. As a group we are gonna use Trello to decide what tasks need to get accomplished and in what order. Using this style allows us to not only see what we still have left, but allows us to see who's working on what so in case of a communication breakdown we are covered.

The next tool we utilized is Github. We created a development branch in order to push all of our experimental changes before pushing them to main. This will allows us to track commits easier and undo mistakes in case they show up. As insurance we set it to where all four memebers of the group have to agree to the merge in main before the pull request is granted. We also have it set to where two members need to be able to push to the dev branch, which is useful for when we peer program.
