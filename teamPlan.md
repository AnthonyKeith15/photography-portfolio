Arturo:

Anthony:

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

With a group that has an incredible artistic vision, choosing a project that has a more creative element will help us showcase the our core compentency.

A weakness were going to have in inexperience as most of the group is still faily new to coding.

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Between all of our group memebers, our weakness is going to be javascript. Today is going to be a good day to work with adding and maniplulating DOM elements , as well as css flex box.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Day to day work will be done according to our plan. As a group were going to agree on certain deadlines. In order to make sure nobody gets left behind when we reach a hold point, were going to do a group check in. Anyone who is struggling will have a chance to speak up openly, and as a group we can get caught up.

## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Our plan is to just be open and honest and lay out issues. As a group of veterans were not afraid to speak our minds and that will be a huge asset to us. If that doesn't work we can take a vote. It that doesn't work were gonna flip a coin.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

In order to combat this, we have decided to make all important decisions as a team. We made an agreement to not move past a certain point until the whole team agrees. As long as we keep the open communcation things should be okay.


### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Were going to need to look out for eachother, As a team. Were going to just openly communicate if something sounds out of scope, were just going to speak up. Were all use to working on smaller teams so this should be a fairly easy proccess.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

By switching up task, we make misteaks as humans and sometimes bite off more than we can chew. By having measureable tasks were able to divide up the work into more manageable pieces and then help eachother knock these tasks out. Maintaining the hold points we set in place and stopping to catch everyone up will help combat this problem.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If our attempts are unsuccessful we can regroup and as a team and decide on our next tasks. We know what our MVP is how we define success so knowing where to go is pretty easy

## Communication 

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

We set a hard limit to 1030pm for phone calls, outside of that we can text to see if were available outside of regular hours

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

We created a group chat using apple features in order to communicate effectivlely.

### How often will you take breaks?

Hourly

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

We as a team agreed that putting in an extra hour, either before class or after to catch up is the first option. After that check stack overflow, then ask TAs or remo for help.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Text message, if were up we will see it, if its important we will call.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Checking in with eachother is important. Were a group of vets so were all used to having a roll call in the morning to check in with eachother so were going to maintain that same working strategy.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Jokes lighten the environment, as were all vets we have a similiar work ethic and are able to just speak our minds freely.

### Work Plan

Were going to utilize trello boards to kinda plan things out and see how we are doing time wise.

### Git process

We agreed nothing will get merged until we come as a group, we will work on projects together. We will leave the main branch untouched and create a "beta" before we merge to main


# Prep Project 2

## Pitch 1 Idea

The idea for our first pitch would be a website in order to show off a photographers portfolio. The problem that it solves is driving traffic and aquiring new customers. We wanted to approach this project like an actual client was coming to us and wants us to help their branding. We also want the website to have a focus on user accessiblilty. Being able to appeal to a wider audicence will increase revenue for the business, which means our web design was successfull.

Features : comprehensive design, photography carosoule using Javascript. Focus on user accessability.

MVP: User accessibility, making a design that attracts the user to the portfolio

## Pitch 2 Idea

The idea for our second pitch would be a game. This would solve bordom and we want them to keep coming back and playing our game. We would approach this from a purely functionality standpoint where the controls and how the game plays would be the important thing.

Features would be: a high score function using local storage, and smooth animations using css.

MVP: Fun, functional, fun
